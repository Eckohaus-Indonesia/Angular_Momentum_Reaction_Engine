### **Angular Momentum: Reaction Engine**  

#### **Boundary Momentum**  
A square root calculator for definitions of binary, or *"ENERGY AS A UNIT"*.  
- Calculates the root metrics for eigenvalues.  
- Defines the principle state of inflation or deflation.  
- Generates the core metrics within a tangential vector.

### **Lambda**  
- Incorporates core metrics from **Boundary Momentum**.  
- Calculates volatility metrics for eigenvalues.  
- Defines statistical curvature or wave structure.
