# **Angular Momentum Reaction Engine (2020)**  
*Statistical Modeling Tools for Energy-As-A-Unit Calculus*  

### **Overview**  
This repository is a Deepseek rewrite of the original calcus presented in V1 Angular Momentum. The calculus and formulae are inherently pitched towards IOT ( Internet of Things ). The repository provides computational tools for analyzing **energetic conversions** through:  
- **Multi/Single Variable Calculus** frameworks  
- **Lambda Field Projections** (eigenvalue mappings)  
- **Boundary Momentum Sequencers** (growth-in-division models)  

⚠️ **Always enable 'Log Scaling' when re-importing XLS files.**

## **Core Concepts**  

### **1. Lambda Projections**  
- Models energy as discrete units (*Eigenvalues*) in relativistic frames.  
- **Wave 6 Instability**: Field inversions causing attenuation.

### **2. Infinities Framework**  
#### **A. Assigned Infinities**  
- **Transport Model**: Electron-driven energy loss/gain vectors:  
  ```math  
  \text{Single Variable: } \frac{1.5578}{0.102414319819447} \times 0.05  
  ```  
  ```math  
  \text{Multi-Variable: } \frac{1.5578}{0.102414319819447} \div 0.95  
  ```  

#### **B. Continuous Infinities**  
- Nuclear ratios *prior* to assignment (lossless state).  

### **3. Base Power Ratios**  
Key nuclear resonance relationships:  
```  
1.14 | 1.15 | 1.16 | 1.17 | 1.18  
```  
- **Optimal precision**: `^1.14` (statistically validated).
