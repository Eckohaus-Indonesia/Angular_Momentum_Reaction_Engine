#### The Hydrogen Equation In Binary.

###### Chemical signatures are created through nucleated bridges. Which combine both narrow and long waves of electromagnetic fields, within a particular boundary space of nuclear resonance.

##### The combination of H2O begins with the creation of a Hydrogen ion. The field space is defined by (Q/(delta t^-3). The nuclear resonance is established at 1.5578 (Reference Library/Original equation)
